								<h3>Google Cloud platform</h3>
								<p>Cloud Computing is rapidly emerging technology and the very notion that high compution tasks can be performed without having the on-premise infrastructure is promising, and I dont see why companies in the future start to operate wiht this as standard. I have earned certifications of many courses in Google Cloud Platform, and I strive to get most GCP professional certificates</p>

								<p>A Characteristic feature of modern seld driving cars that is detecting road lane and lines detection.This functionality is achieved through OpenCV(Open source Computer Vision library).I made this project in Python.----Click on the project title to see the code.</p>

								<h3><a href="https://github.com/Syed-Affan-Hameed/Traffic_sign_recogniser">Traffic Sign Detection</a></h3>
								<p>A vital feature in Automatic cars these days is the ability to detect and recognise the traffic signs at real timea dnmake decisions based on it.The implementation is a bit complex as the model should recognise the traffic sign board on any given angle and comparitively less visibility.I made this projects with the help of Machine Learning Algortihm,using Convolution Neural Networks.</p>
